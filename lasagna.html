                    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                    <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
                    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
                    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
                    <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
                    <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
                    <li>1 egg</li>
                    <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
                    <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, cook the Italian sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Drain off any excess fat.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon of salt, and pepper. Add 2 tablespoons of parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1.5 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to package directions. Drain and rinse with cold water to prevent sticking.</li>
                    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with the egg, the remaining 2 tablespoons of parsley, and the remaining ½ teaspoon of salt.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                    <li>To assemble, spread about 1.5 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange a single layer of noodles over the sauce. Spread with half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1.5 cups of meat sauce over the mozzarella, and sprinkle with ¼ cup of Parmesan cheese.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the layers, and top with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover the dish with foil. To prevent sticking, either spray the foil with cooking spray or make sure it does not touch the cheese.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the top is bubbly and lightly browned.</li>
                    <li>Let the lasagna rest for 15 minutes before serving. This will help it hold its shape when cut.</li>
