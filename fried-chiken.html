                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons black pepper, plus 1 teaspoon</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons salt, plus 1 teaspoon</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon cayenne pepper</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                    <li>1 (3-4 pound) chicken, cut into 8 pieces</li>
                    <li>3 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix together 3 cups of flour, paprika, 3 tablespoons pepper, 2 tablespoons salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper.</li>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs and water. In a third bowl, place the remaining 1 cup of flour.</li>
                    <li>Dip each piece of chicken in the egg mixture, then dredge in the seasoned flour mixture. Dip it back into the egg mixture, and then dredge it a second time in the seasoned flour. Place the coated chicken on a wire rack.</li>
                    <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. The oil should be about 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Carefully place chicken pieces into the hot oil, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for about 6-8 minutes on each side, until golden brown and cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Remove the chicken from the skillet and place it on a clean wire rack to drain. Season with the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper.</li>
                </ol>
